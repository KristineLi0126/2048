### 2048 puzzle game

------------


Welcome to the 2048 puzzle game! This is a project containing a program allowing players to play on a plain 4x4 grid. We have set four different difficulty levels for players: Easy, Middle, Hard, and nightmare. Each tile has a number on it and it will slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. A new tile with a value of 2 will randomly appear in an empty spot of the grid when the players move. Two tiles with the same number collide when the player moves, they will merge into one tile with the total value of two tiles. The larger the value is, the darker the colour of the tile. This game is won based on the different levels that the player chooses. Players can continue to get a higher score until the player has no legal move, which means there are no empty cells and no more merging, the game ends.

Once you open the file, you can see four different difficulty levels. Players can choose any level they like and start this game by moving tiles. Players will use the arrow keys to move the tiles on the board. If two tiles with the same value collide, they will merge into one tile with the total value of the two tiles. The game ends when there are no more possible moves left.

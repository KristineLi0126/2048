------------


Welcome to 2048 puzzle game!This is a project contains a program allowing players to play on a plain 4×4 grid. We have set four different diffculty levels for palyers, which are Easy, Middle, Hard and nighmare. Each tile gas a number on it and it will slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. A new tile with a value of 2 or 4 will randomly appears in an empty spot of grid when the players move. When two tiles with the same number collide when the player move, they will merge into one tile with the total value of two tiles. The larger the value is, the darker the color of tile. 
This game is won based on different level that the player choose, player can continue to get a higher score until the player has no legel move, which means there are no empty spot and tiles with the same value, the game ends.
